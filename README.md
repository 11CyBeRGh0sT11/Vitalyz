## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the Vitalyz mobile application locally.

### Prerequisites

* *[REQUIRED SOFTWARE 1, e.g., Flutter SDK]*
* *[REQUIRED SOFTWARE 2, e.g., A specific IDE like Android Studio or VS Code]*
* An Android or iOS device/emulator.

### Installation

    # Replace with your project's dependency command (e.g., flutter pub get)
    
3.  *Backend Configuration (Firebase):*
    To connect to the backend, you must add your own Firebase configuration files (google-services.json for Android and GoogleService-Info.plist for iOS). This setup handles the data flow from the simulated watch to the app.
4.  *Run the application:*
    bash
    # Replace with your project's run command (e.g., flutter run)
